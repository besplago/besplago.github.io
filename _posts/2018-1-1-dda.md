title: "Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (High School Final Exam Project)"
---

For my final exam project in high school for the subject "Teknikfag (Digital design og udvikling) (Technology subjects (Digital design and development))", I chose to investigate the concept of Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in video games. DDA is a technique used to adjust the difficulty of a game based on the player's skill level. The goal of this project was to explore the different methods of implementing DDA in video games and to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in enhancing the player experience.
