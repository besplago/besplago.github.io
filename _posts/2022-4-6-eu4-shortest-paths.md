For my bachelor's project in computer science at the University of Copenhagen, I chose to investigate the concept of shortest paths in the grand strategy game Europa Universalis IV (EU4). The goal of this project was to explore the different methods of finding the shortest paths between provinces in the game and to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in enhancing the currently static pathfinding system in the game.
