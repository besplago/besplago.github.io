*Mafia card game calculator in use.*

The Mafia card game is a party game created by my friends. As the game contains some bookkeeping, I decided to create a calculator to help players keep track of the game's state. The calculator is a mobile app that allows players to keep track of the game's state, including the number of players, each player's amount of money, members of teams, players with special roles, etc.

The app was implemented Unity and C#. While this may not be ideal, I chose this as I wanted to relearn Unity and C#, as I had not used them for a while.
