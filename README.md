# My Portfolio
My portfolio based on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme [no style, please!](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please).

## Adding a new "post"
When adding a new post, the theme wants the .md file to be of the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. This is because the theme uses the date in the file name to generate the post date. I have removed the display of the date, though the file still needs to be named in this format.
